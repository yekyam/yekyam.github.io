# The Zen of Python
The Zen of Python is a collection of guidelines for writing software, primarily aims towards (you guessed it) Python. It's a short list, but its worth its weight in gold. The guidelines talk about issues like code structure and how a program should look.

# The Beginner's Axioms
I thought it'd be fun to make my own list, which I dub *The Beginner's Axioms*. Its a short list of guidelines I wish I could've handed to myself when I first started learning how to program.

* Learn slowly, forget slowly
* Writing is better than reading.
* When reading, official is better than unofficial.
* Bad code is better than no code.
* Mistakes are better than no mistakes.
* The first step to fixing a problem is admission.
* Community is better than solitude.
* Comments, comments, comments.
* Experiment, experiment, experiment.
