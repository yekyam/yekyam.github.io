## Programmer Axis

```
                               Heavy Abstractions
                                     ^
                                     |
                                     |    
                                     |
Check doc first, code later <-----------------> Code first, check docs later
                                     |
                                     |
                                     |
                                     v
                               Low Abstractions
```

I think most programmers fall somewhere on this plane. Personally, I'd be found somewhere in the first quadrant. 

## Utility?

It's important to reflect on tendencies as a programmer.
