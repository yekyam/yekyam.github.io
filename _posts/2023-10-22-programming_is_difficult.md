For some reason, I see a lot of beginners post something like this online: "I've been programming for a month now and it's still difficult. Is programming right for me?" 

Newsflash: Programming *is hard*. Learning to program *is hard*. In fact, *any skill is hard*. 

Let's take our statement from earlier and replace it with an instrument. Let's read it out together: "I've been [playing] the violin for a month now and it's still difficult. Is [playing] the violin right for me?"

To be frank, the statement now sounds kind of ridiculous. Unless you're a prodigy, of course the violin is still difficult, it's an instrument that requires years of practice. 

Programming is no different. It's a skill. If you want to be good at programming, it requires years of hard work.

I think the reason why beginner programmers feel "stuck" is because the progress they make isn't immediately obvious. Let's go back to our violin example: our beginner violinist would have no difficulty in knowing what a good violinist sounds like, and there's a clear benchmark they can compare themselves to. It's not too difficult to hear when a violinist messes up a note, rushes a piece, or has a scratchy tone.

However, our beginner programmer has no clear benchmark. It's part of the reason why companies have a difficult time creating a good interview process: there's no clear, easy way to distinguish the quality between two programmers. To do so, you'd have to take a deep dive into their projects, methods, ability to break down problems, etc. Even then, it's still not easy, and there's a lot of nuances to consider. 

That's not to say I don't empathize; every programmer has been there before. Every programmer has stared at a screen for hours and felt like they were deciphering a set of ancient texts. Every programmer has felt frustrated out of their mind, only to solve the problem days later. We've all been there, and *it's okay to feel frustrated.*

Yes, programming is hard, but it's not impossible. Stick with it, and good luck. 

There's a wonderful article by Peter Norvig about how to [teach yourself programming in ten years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).
