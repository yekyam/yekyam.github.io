- add a tab for articles (probably just need to update menus.yml and change _posts to _articles)
- add a tab for projects (probably just need to update menus.yml and to _projects)

nevermind, looks difficult. maybe add a tag to posts in the header (tags: project or tags:article) and try to filter like that
	wll need to add a articles.html and projects.html
